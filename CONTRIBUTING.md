# How To Contribute

“vim-python-pep8-indent” is always open for suggestions and contributions by generous developers. I’ve collected a few tipps to get you started.

Please:

- *Always* add tests for your code.
- Add yourself to the AUTHORS.rst file in an alphabetical fashion by first name – no matter how big or small your changes are.
- Write [good commit messages].
- Ideally, [squash] your commits, i.e. make your pull requests just one commit.

Thank you for considering to contribute!
