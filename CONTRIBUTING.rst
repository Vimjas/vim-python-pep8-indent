How To Contribute
=================

``vim-python-pep8-indent`` is always open for suggestions and contributions by generous developers.
Iâ€™ve collected a few tips to get you started.

Please:

- *Always* add tests for your code.
- Write `good commit messages`_.


Running Tests
-------------

- They are written in Ruby_ (sorry :() using vimrunner_ which requires rspec_.
- The tests go into ``spec/indent/indent_spec.rb``.
  Look at the ``describe`` blocks to get the hang of it.
- Run the tests with the command::

   $ rspec spec
